# FLEX

This repository contains architecture, compiler and design space exploration framework for FLEX, a novel CGRA architecture with flexible execution spectrum. FLEX introduces spatio-temporal vector dataflow execution for variable vector length(v). For each application kernel, FLEX DSE framework will perform exploration and will choose the best execution mode/ vector length(v). Please find the [paper]() for more details.
